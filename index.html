        <p>The Truly Wild Art Gallery was founded in 2016 by Mama Lione. Located in Wild St. 485, the gallery 
        receives many modern art lovers everyday. The exhibitions are always evolving and our staff is constantly 
        searching for new pieces to provide the ultimate Modern Art Experience. We might come from the wild but 
        this is no monkey business, every piece is authentic.</p>
        <p>With over 50 art pieces, 15 different themed sections and a spacious structure, it is appropriate for
        visitors of all ages and we have entertainment for the whole family. The gallery also has its own restaurant
        ran by Kevin Bark, one of the most renowned chefs in the Animal Kingdom and winner of many awards. Our 
        history speaks for itself, come meet our staff and enjoy the exhibition!</p>

          <h3 class="review-title">It's great and all... but watch out for the monkey</h3>
          <p>The gallery is organized and clean. The art is top notch and very distinct. However you have to be careful with your food; the monkey kept stealing my son's snacks! I had to leave early because he wouldn't stop crying.</p>

          <p>The tour was so good, very educative and the art is amazing. Loved the food in the restaurant, even though the monkey kept watching my plate. The staff's intern is the cutest thing you'll ever meet, I'm completely in love!</p>
