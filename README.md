# Company Homepage Project

This project is a homepage designed for the fictional Truly Wild Art Gallery, an art gallery ran entirely by animals.

The webpage is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, which was achieved by using Flexbox and media queries.

You can find the live version [here](https://pedro-freddi.github.io/company-homepage/).
